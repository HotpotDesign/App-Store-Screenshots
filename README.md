# App Store Screenshots
This guide is written by https://myhotpot.io. We make it easy to create attractive [App Store screenshots](https://myhotpot.io/templates/iphone_xs_max?s=github), [Google Play screenshots](https://myhotpot.io/templates/samsung_s9?s=github), Chrome Store screenshots, [app icons](https://myhotpot.io/templates/app_store_icon), and other graphics needed for apps, websites, and extensions.

## Overview
App screenshots are crucial for engaging users on the App Store, Google Play, and the Chrome Store. With almost one million apps competing for user attention, studies show many consumers only browse for a few seconds before deciding whether to download an app.

## App Store Screenshot Sizes

The following screenshot sizes are required for the App Store, although Apple has thankfully simplified the process by allowing developers to submit screenshots only for the iPhone XS Max and iPad Pro. The App Store will automatically downsize these to the smaller sizes required. If you're tight on time and budget, we recommend this approach rather than creating individual screenshots for each device. There is no proof device-specific screenshots influence download rates.
