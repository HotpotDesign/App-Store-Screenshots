# App Store Screenshots
This guide is written by https://hotpot.ai. We make it easy to create attractive [App Store screenshots](https://hotpot.ai/templates/iphone_xs_max?s=github), [Google Play screenshots](https://hotpot.ai/templates/samsung_s9?s=github), Chrome Store screenshots, [app icons](https://hotpot.ai/templates/app_store_icon), and other graphics needed for apps, websites, and extensions.

This is a companion article to the one on [Google Play Screenshots](https://github.com/HotpotDesign/Google-Play-Screenshots).

The goal with these posts is to help developers understand the requirements and best practices for marketing apps on the App Store and Google Play.

## App Store Screenshot Examples

[Click here](https://hotpot.ai/templates/iphone_xs_max?s=github) to see examples of App Store screenshots from Hotpot Design. These examples include all iOS devices required for App Store inclusion, including the iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone XS Max, and iPad Pro.

## Overview
App screenshots are crucial for engaging users on the App Store, Google Play, and the Chrome Store. With almost one million apps competing for user attention, studies show many consumers only browse for a few seconds before deciding whether to download an app.

## App Store Screenshot Sizes

The following screenshot sizes are required for the Apple App Store, although Apple lets developers submit screenshots for only the iPhone XS Max and 12.9-Inch iPad Pro. The App Store automatically downsizes these screenshots to the other device sizes. If you're tight on time and budget, we recommend this approach rather than creating individual screenshots for each device. There is no proof device-specific screenshots influence download rates.
